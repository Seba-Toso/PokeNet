Find them, capture them, and save them to your Pokédex for later viewing.</p>

<h4>You can even play with it</h4>
<p>This project was deployed in gh-pages 🙌. <a href="https://seba-toso.github.io/Pokenet/login" title="https://seba-toso.github.io/Pokenet/login">Here</a></p>
<h4>Or follow these  steps to clone the repository</h4>
<p>Whoa, hold on!👮‍♂️ Before you make a move, you need to have git and yarn package manager installed on your PC.<em>(You may find the links at the bottom)</em>

<h2>WOW, I made it!🤯 But, how does this thing WORK</h2>
<p>The web app has a login page,  screen and an "about" page. <br>
<br>
<strong>Home Screen</strong><br>
The web app has a login page, followed by a home page where you will find all your stats. A navigation bar on the right of the screen will allow you to travel to the world to capture Pokémon's, or access your Pokédex and see all those you captured and their most important data.<br>
And that's it.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p><strong>Live long and prosper</strong> 🖖</p>
